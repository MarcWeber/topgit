TopGit -- A Different Patch Queue Manager
=========================================

Overview
--------

TopGit manages one or more "patch queue"s (aka "patch set"s) using
Git.

Whereas a utility such as `quilt` maintains each individual patch
as a "diff" file on disk, TopGit (the `tg` command) maintains each
individual patch as _two_ branches in Git -- the patch's "branch"
and the patch's "base branch".  The patch itself is simply the
"diff" from the patch's "base branch" to the patch's "branch".

Whereas a utilty such as `quilt` maintains the list of active patch
"diff" files and the correct order to apply them in a file (the
`series` file), TopGit maintains this information in a `.topdeps`
file that is part of each patch's "branch".

TopGit maintains any desired "documentation" (aka the patch header)
in a `.topmsg` file that is also part of each patch's "branch" and
prepends it when generating a patch "diff".


TopGit Advantages
-----------------

### Patch Dependency Topology

Whereas the `series` file in Quilt is (obviously) limited to a
"linear" topology, TopGit's `.topdeps` file is not.

For example, consider that you have three patches:

 1. add "feature A"
 2. add "feature B"
 3. add "feature C" that requires both feature A and feature B

If "feature A" and "feature B" are completely independent features,
then the order that the "feature A" and "feature B" patches are
applied does not matter as long as they are both applied before the
"feature C" patch.

TopGit can represent this by listing both the "feature A" and
"feature B" patches in the `.topdeps` file for the "feature C"
patch.

### Patch Change History

Whereas with Quilt there is no history of changes (aka edits) to a
patch (unless explicit backups are made along the way), all changes
to a patch in TopGit are made via regular Git commands.

This means all the standard Git introspection commands (e.g. "log",
"diff", "bisect", "blame", etc.) are available to view the history
of an individual patch.

### Patch Updating

With Quilt when the "upstream" sources are updated (or even an early
patch in the series is updated) in such a way as to cause a patch
to no longer apply cleanly, the patch must be fixed by hand.

With TopGit, the full Git merge machinery is used to merge the
"upstream" changes (or changes to an earlier patch) into the patches
in dependency topological order.  This can often avoid patch
conflicts.

In the case where a patch must be fixed by hand (yes, this still
can happen in TopGit), the Git `rerere` (reuse recorded resolution)
mechanism can be used to record the hand-crafted fix and later
automatically reuse that fix when needed.

### Patch Identification

When there are a very large number of patches in a patch set, it
may be difficult to remember (especially if you're not the original
author) which individual patch of a "patch set" contains a particular
change.

After using the various Git introspection commands (e.g. "log",
"diff", "bisect", "blame", etc.) to locate a commit containing a
particular change, the TopGit `tg contains` command can be used to
identify the individual patch of a "patch set" that logically
contains that commit.

In other words, `tg contains` identifies which TopGit branch would
produce a patch "diff" file that makes the change introduced by the
given commit.

### Collaboration

Because TopGit stores all information directly in Git, all of Git's
normal push/pull/remote functionality can be used to collaborate
on and/or share TopGit "patch set"s with others.


TopGit Features
---------------

### Multiple Patch Sets

With Quilt it is possible to use different `series` files to combine
patch "diff" files into different arrangements (e.g.  for different
machine architectures or development branches).

TopGit also allows multiple "patch set"s to exist at the same time
where a single "patch" may be used by more than one "patch set".

### Patch Set History

As an alternative to maintaining two or more different versions of
the same patch (e.g. for different development branches) under
different names such as, for example, "patch1-oldstable", "patch1-stable"
and "patch1-unstable", it's possible to use a TopGit tag to record
the state of a "patch set" (via the `tg tag` command) and then later
go back to that state (via the `tg shell` command) to, for example,
produce an updated patch set for an older software version and
record that new state of the older software version "patch set"
without disturbing the current version of the "patch set".

The advantage of using this mechanism is that the branch names for
the individual patches always remain the same no matter how many
different versions are being kept.

### Import and Export

TopGit can import and export "patch set"s to other formats.  This
includes the one "diff" file per patch and one "commit" per patch
formats.

This makes it easy to produce a set of "diff" patch files on demand
for external (e.g. non-Git) use for a "patch set".


TopGit Downsides
----------------

Forget about using `git rebase` on a TopGit branch (either a patch's
"branch" or its "base branch").  With the exception being commits
that have not yet been merged into any other patch's "branch" or
"base branch".

The merge history for a "patch set" can become rather complex as a
"patch set" is maintained over time (via the `tg update` command)
since nothing is ever thrown away.

TopGit has a learning curve and those unfamiliar with Git will need
to become comfortable with Git too.
